List:
Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.

Lists are one of 4 built-in data types in Python used to store collections of data, the other 3 are Tuple, Set, and Dictionary, all with different qualities and usage.

Lists are created using square brackets:
Create a List:

thislist = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
print(thislist)

# Notes on List Slicing and Assignment:
# - When you use mylist[start:end], it returns a new list containing the elements from index 'start' up to, but not including, 'end'.
# - If start and end are the same (e.g., mylist[1:1]), the result is an empty list because there are no elements between those indices.
# - Assigning a list to a slice (e.g., mylist[1:1] = ["a", "b"]) will insert the new elements at that position, shifting the existing elements to the right.
# - If you assign a string (not a list) to a slice, each character of the string will be inserted as a separate element.
# - Slicing and assignment can be used to insert, replace, or remove elements in a list efficiently.
# - Example: mylist[2:4] = ["x", "y"] will replace elements at index 2 and 3 with "x" and "y".
# - Example: mylist[1:3] = [] will remove elements at index 1 and 2.
# - Slicing is a powerful tool for manipulating lists in Python!

# Let's explain this logic step by step:

# When you use mylist[1:1], it means you are slicing from index 1 up to (but not including) index 1.
# Since the start and end are the same, there are no elements between them, so it returns an empty list:
