## filter() in Python


The **filter()** function is used to extract elements from an iterable (like a list, tuple, or set) that satisfy a given condition.  
It works by applying a function to each element and keeping only those for which the function returns `True`.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Syntax
```python
filter(function, iterable)
````

---

## ðŸ”¹ Parameters

* **function**: A function that tests each element.

  * Returns `True` â†’ Keep the element
  * Returns `False` â†’ Discard the element
* **iterable**: Any iterable (list, tuple, set, etc.).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Return Value

A **filter object** (an iterator), which can be converted into a list, tuple, set, etc.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Example 1: Using `filter()` with a Named Function

This code defines a regular function to check if a number is even and then uses `filter()` to extract all even numbers from a list.

```python
def even(n):
    return n % 2 == 0

a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
b = filter(even, a)
print(list(b))  # Convert filter object to a list
```

### âœ… Output

```
[2, 4, 6]
```

---

## ðŸ”¹ Explanation

1. `even` function checks if a number is divisible by 2.
2. `filter()` applies this function to each item in `a`.
3. Only even numbers are included in the output.
